### Canvas Configuration
#### STEP 1: Import and transform data
- In Transform Data, check for data quality under View Tab: using column quality and distribution
- Close and apply
- Set the transaction_time datatype to hh:nn:ss


<BR>

#### STEP 2: Canvas Configuration
- Add canvas background
- In canvas setting, set Type to custom: (H: 850, W: 1400) 
- Vertical alignment: middle
- Canvas background - image fit : select fit

<br>

#### STEP 3: Create A Date Table
```DAX
DateTable = ADDCOLUMNS (
	CALENDAR ( MIN('YourDataTable'[Date]), MAX('YourDataTable'[Date]) ),
	"Year", YEAR([Date]),
	"Month", FORMAT([Date], "MMMM"),
	"MonthNum", MONTH([Date]),
	"Quarter", "Q" & FORMAT([Date], "Q"),
	"Weekday", FORMAT([Date], "dddd"),
	"WeekdayNum", WEEKDAY([Date], 2) )
```


<BR>

#### STEP 4: Data Modeling
- Add a relationship between Date Table and Transactions table
- Under Model View, connect the 2 tables
- Drag the date in the Date Table on the transaction_date in Transactions Table
- The relationship is Many to One.

## Business Questions: KPI Section

### 1. Total Sales Analysis with month-on-month increase or decrease in sales
- create total sales measure
```DAX
Total Sales = SUMX(Transactions, Transactions[unit_price] * Transactions[transaction_qty])
```

```DAX 
MoM Sales % Change = 
	IF( NOT(ISBLANK([Previous Month Sales])), 
	DIVIDE([MoM Sales Difference], [Previous Month Sales], 0), 
	BLANK() )	
```

```DAX
Month-Year = FORMAT(DateTable[Date], "MMM YYYY")
```

- Add slicer, Add Month-Year column to the slicer. Format and Sort the slicer

- Total Sales KPI to display the MoM diff & percentage 
```DAX
KPI Total Sales = 
	VAR MoM_Diff = [MoM Sales Difference]
	VAR Mom_Percent = [MoM Sales % Change]
	VAR CurrentMonth = SELECTEDVALUE('DateTable'[MonthNumb])

	RETURN
	IF(
	CurrentMonth = 1,
	BLANK(), 
	FORMAT(MoM_Diff/1000, "0.0K") & " | " & FORMAT(mom_percent, "#0.0%") & " " & "MoM diff" & " " & "vs LM" )
```

<br>

### 2. Total Orders Analysis

- Create Total orders measure
```DAX
	Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(Transactions[transaction_id])
```

- Create the Previous Month Orders Measure

	 Orders Previous Month = CALCULATE([Total Orders], DATEADD('DateTable'[Date], -1, MONTH) )
```

- Calculate the Month-over-Month (MoM) Difference
```DAX
	MoM Orders Difference = [Total Orders] - [Orders Previous Month]
```

- Calculate the Month-over-Month Percentage Change
```DAX
	MoM Order % Change = 
	IF( NOT(ISBLANK([Orders Previous Month])), DIVIDE([MoM Orders Difference], [Orders Previous Month], 0), BLANK())
```

- Orders MoM KPI
```DAX
	KPI Total Orders = 
		VAR MoM_Diff = [MoM Orders Difference]
		VAR Mom_Percent = [MoM Order % Change]
		VAR CurrentMonth = SELECTEDVALUE('DateTable'[MonthNum])
		RETURN
		IF( CurrentMonth = 1, BLANK(), 
		MoM_Diff & " | " & FORMAT(mom_percent, "#0.0%") & " " & "MoM diff" & " " & "vs LM" )
```

- Add card, Add Total Orders on it. Then format the card
- Add another card, drag on Orders MoM KPI
- Format the card to merge it with Total Orders Card

<br>


### 3. Total Quantity Sold Analysis

- Create the Total Quantity Sold Measure
```DAX
	Total Quantity Sold = SUM(Transactions[transaction_qty])
```


- Create the Previous Month Quantity Sold Measure
```DAX
	Previous Month Quantity Sold = CALCULATE([Total Quantity Sold], DATEADD('DateTable'[Date], -1, MONTH))
```

- Calculate the Month-over-Month (MoM) Difference
```DAX
	MoM Quantity Difference = [Total Quantity Sold] - [Previous Month Quantity Sold]
```

- Calculate the Month-over-Month Percentage Change
```DAX
	MoM Quantity % Change = 
	IF(
		NOT(ISBLANK([Previous Month Quantity Sold])),
		DIVIDE([MoM Quantity Difference], [Previous Month Quantity Sold], 0), BLANK() )
```

- Total Quantity mom KPI 
```DAX
	KPI Total Quantity = 
		VAR MoM_Diff = [MoM Quantity Difference]
		VAR Mom_Percent = [MoM Quantity % Change]
		VAR CurrentMonth = SELECTEDVALUE('DateTable'[MonthNum])
		RETURN
		IF( CurrentMonth = 1, BLANK(), 
		MoM_Diff & " | " & FORMAT(mom_percent, "#0.0%") & " " & "MoM Diff" & " " & "vs LM" )
```
