## SQL Solution Section
### Data Extraction and Cleaning

#### 1: Create table coffee_sales
```SQL
CREATE TABLE coffee_sales
	(transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY, 
	transaction_date DATE, 
	transaction_time VARCHAR(10), 
	transaction_qty INT, 
	store_id INT, 
	store_location TEXT, 
	product_id INT, 
	unit_price DOUBLE, 
	product_category TEXT, 
	product_type TEXT, 
	product_detail TEXT);
```

- Verify Table
```SQL
SELECT * FROM coffee_sales;
```
```SQL
DESCRIBE coffee_sales;
```

<BR>

#### 2: Import the dataset into coffee_sales table
```SQL
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:\\ProgramData\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 8.0\\Uploads\\Coffee_shop_sales.csv'
INTO TABLE coffee_sales
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;    
```

- Verify Import
```SQL
SELECT * FROM coffee_sales;
```
```SQL
DESCRIBE coffee_sales;
```
<BR>

#### 3: Create a Worksheet Table (to protect the raw file) and insert dataset

```SQL
CREATE TABLE coffee_worksheet LIKE coffee_sales;
```

- verify table
```SQL
DESCRIBE coffee_worksheet;
```

<BR>

#### 4: Insert a copy of dataset into coffee worksheet table
```SQL
INSERT INTO coffee_worksheet
SELECT * FROM coffee_sales;
```

- Verify dataset
```SQL
SELECT * FROM coffee_worksheet;
```

<BR>

#### 5: Data Cleaning
#### Update transaction_time to TIME standard format and ALTER the datatype

- Step A: Update transaction time
```SQL
UPDATE coffee_worksheet
SET 
	transaction_time = STR_TO_DATE(transaction_time, '%H:%i:%s');
```

- Step B: Alter Datatype
```SQL
ALTER TABLE coffee_worksheet
MODIFY transaction_time TIME;
```

- verify changes
```SQL
DESCRIBE COFFEE_WORKSHEET;
```
```SQL
SELECT * FROM COFFEE_WORKSHEET;
```
